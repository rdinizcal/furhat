# Cookin' with Furhat

*Goal:* Inspire users to make healthy and versatile meals.

*Problem:* Imagine getting home to the kitchen, opening the fridge, and seeing that you have chicken fillets but no idea of what to make of them. Here we have the Furhat dinner planner ready to assist you. 

*Solution:* The robot could be used in the following way: First, it could respond to attention i.e., when the user needs help. From here, the robot would assist the user in deciding what meal to make after the users' preferences. The preferences could be something like random, a favorite, something with chicken, or something new. When the dish has been decided, Furhat could help fetch a recipe and then allow the user to make a shopping list. If or when all ingredients are available, Furhat could help the user cook.  In this case, Furhat can tell the user the procedure and clarifying words when there is a need. Finally, the robot can collect a score of how well the food tasted to be used for future sessions.
